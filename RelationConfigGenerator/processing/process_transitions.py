    Process transitions to generate class methods and interfaces.

    This function processes a list of transitions to generate the class methods and interfaces required for
    the include configuration. It constructs method signatures based on the current state and next states,
    and updates the interfaces dictionary with the appropriate interface methods.

    Args:
        transitions (list): A list of transition dictionaries. Each dictionary should have the keys
                            'current_state', 'next_states', and optionally 'path'.
        all_relevant_states (set): A set of states that are relevant for processing.
        interfaces (dict): A dictionary to store the interfaces and their methods.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the class definition string and a set of class interfaces.
