def complete_paths(data):
    """
    Complete and sort paths for an entity.

    This function takes a dictionary containing an entity and its paths, completes any missing intermediate paths,
    and returns a sorted list of all paths. The paths are sorted first by the number of segments and then
    lexicographically.

    Args:
        data (dict): A dictionary with the following keys:
            - "Entity" (str): The name of the entity.
            - "paths" (list): A list of strings representing the paths.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the entity name and a sorted list of all paths, including any intermediate paths.
              The dictionary has the following structure:
              {
                  "Entity": <entity_name>,
                  "paths": <sorted_paths>
